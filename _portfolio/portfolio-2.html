Challenge of classifying legal documents, such as ones from Federal Communication Commissions, using various state-of-art sentence vectorization and unsupervised classification method.

The current code includes the FCC API key that was used to scrap the documents from EFCS data base. A new regulations.gov API Key can be requested and registered with a working institutional e-mail as the currently registered e-mail has expired.

params.py contains a basic structure to simply add/delete attributes to a parameter class. In the current code, I decided to put all the directory informations and dynamically-obtained json files to have instant access to it while the code is running so that one does not have to make a file-read whenever we need access to the documents.

The current code contains a specific data collecting function from EFCS server using downloadplan.

When scrapping files from FCC, I save the documents from each bucket (which may vary in number) into a folder 'output_docs'. This folder is created if it doesn't exist. Then, it saves the downloadplan data in a txt file in it. Each document/bucket has an id corresponding to it, and for all documents scrapped, the ids are logged dynamically in a txt file 'filing.txt'. Then, optionally, at each time of execution of read on each document, the documents are converted into json and are saved to params AND 'all_json_text.txt', or any chosen name in the parameter, in the global project folder. This makes a cushion for reading json file directly from saved json instead of reading each bucket and converting them into json in case of a failed save in dynamic parameter class.
